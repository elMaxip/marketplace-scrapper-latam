"""Mask secret values in config file content sent to the web UI.

Why
---
The project stores Facebook login credentials and API tokens as plain
values inside ``config.toml``. Serving that file to a browser unmasked
exposes those secrets to devtools, screen-sharing, browser history, and
anyone who logs into the web UI. We redact sensitive values on the way
out and restore them on the way in, so:

  - The editor never has to show the real secret (unless the user
    explicitly types over the mask to set a new one).
  - The user can save without retyping every secret — the mask literal
    ``"<REDACTED>"`` round-trips back to the original value.
  - Typing a real new value over the mask *does* write it through.

Scope
-----
This is a line-based TOML scanner for common flat assignments like
``password = "..."``. It does NOT support multi-line strings, inline
tables, or arrays of strings — those would need a real TOML parser to
redact safely. If a sensitive key uses one of those shapes, we just
leave it unredacted rather than mis-parse it. Users who need that
should split secrets into a separate file (planned follow-up).
